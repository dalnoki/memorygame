## Memory game

This is a simple memory game - with horses! :)

To start the game, you'll need to click on the (Re)start button - if you click on the cards before pushing the button the browser will let you know what to do anyway.

The game counts the guesses you made and the elapsed time and gives you star-rating based on the amount of steps. 

You can shuffle things a bit with the Shuffle button - if you're a real Memory game pro, you can always shuffle during the game ;)
